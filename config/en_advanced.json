	"intro": "<p>Yo! Designing a space telescope is an incredibly complex job, with many requirements that must be met. Some of these are because of the scientific discoveries that the astronomers would like to make, while others are due to limits that the engineers put on the spacecraft. Beginning in the 1990s, astronomers and engineers around the world were busy designing the <a href=\"#previous.herschel\" class=\"guidelink\" data=\"previous\">Herschel Space Observatory</a>. This project will help you explore the kinds of decisions they had to make.</p><p>Your task is to design a space observatory. You will have to make a number of decisions about what your space telescope will look like. If you are in a group, you could use a number of <a href=\"#roles\" class=\"guidelink\" data=\"roles\">roles</a>, but you will need to work together for a final solution</p>",

Mirrors tend to be much lighter and easier to manufacture, and so almost all space telescopes - and large ground-based telescopes - use them instead of lenses.</p><p>The mirror of a telescope is one of the most important parts. It collects the light and focuses it onto the scientific instruments. Bigger mirrors are able to collect more light, and therefore see fainter objects more easily. They also have a higher resolution, and so can see finer detail.</p><p>The maximum possible resolution of a telescope is given by:</p><blockquote><em>R &asymp; 1.22&lambda;/<em>D</em></blockquote><p>where &lambda; is the wavelength of the light, <em>D</em> is the diameter of the telescope. The value of <em>R</em> is in radians. You can convert to other units using the following relations:</p><blockquote>1 radian = (180/&pi;) degrees; 1 degree = 60 arcminutes; 1 arcminute = 60 arcseconds</blockquote><p>This gives the maximum possible resolution that a telescope mirror can provide, and is called the &quot;diffraction limit&quot;. Note that it is different for different wavelengths. On <a href=\"#guide\" class=\"guidelink\" data=\"previous\">previous satellites</a>, not all instruments have taken advantage of this maximum resolution.</p><h3>Diameter</h3><p>A larger mirror will collect more light, however a smaller mirror will collect light at a faster rate.

However, this does not mean a lighter structure, a deployable mirror will have <strong>double the mass</strong> and <strong>4 times the cost</strong> of a non-deployable mirror. It also takes <strong>twice as long for development</strong>, and carries a higher risk of failure or delay.</p><h3>UV Quality</h3><p>A mirror used for observing at ultraviolet wavelengths will need to be far more highly polished than a  mirror used for longer wavelengths. As a result, a UV quality mirror is <strong>twice as expensive to build</strong>.</p>"
